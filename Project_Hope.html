Sometimes, it causes anxiety as not all of us have accepted to wear a mask for the whole day. If we really want to see each other's faces for the rest of our life then it is better to cover our faces till the pandemic gets over. Hence, there is no need to be anxious about wearing a mask and we should drive our actual concern to the precautions required for coronavirus.</p>

Depression is just an American fad caught on by Indian kids, nothing else.” This is largely how our house holds describe what depression is. Their responses to any other mental health associated problem is generally similar too. Frequently known as the disease of the “rich”, it can hardly be generalized on an economic foundation.
                        What we don’t often hear about it, it is real, it is dreadful and it is, if left untreated, life threatening.
                        Early detection and professional help can go a long way in curing it and making your life easier. So speak up, there is nothing wrong in seeking aide.</p>

But, experts say that those physical scars get enough sympathy and treatment which makes it easy to heal from the harm caused. Many suicidal attempts include cases of emotional abuse. The mind stops thinking and makes an individual think that he/she is a loser. It denies to believe in anyone. We ourselves should match the different symptoms from the person's Behaviour and take precautionary actions if required.</p>

In this, we are not ready to accept that the thing or person is not going to come back; this thing takes time to heal up. This loss cannot even be compensated by someone or something else. The only thing we can do is to be with our other loved ones more and more to divert our mind and heart to other things and to move forward in life.

                        People have many different experiences of hearing voices. Some people don't mind their voices or simply find them irritating or distracting, while others find them frightening or intrusive.<br>
                        It's common to think that if you hear voices you must have a mental health problem.<br>
                        But research shows that lots of people hear voices and many of them are not mentally unwell. It’s a relatively common human experience.</p>

                        Researchers have found out that when you believe you have Insomnia, that is fuel for worry.<br>
                        The pain of having Insomnia can be understood by no one other than the person suffering from it. Others think of it as an excuse that the person is making to do less work.<br>
                        But, we at Project hope believe in help everyone suffering from insomnia to cope up with stress of sleeplessness.</p>
